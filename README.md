## Scripts

#### [[Delete all marker.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/Delete%20all%20marker.jsx))

removes all markers from the selected layers in the active composition.

#### [[Delete unnecessary keyframe](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/Delete%20unnecessary%20keyframe%20.jsx))

set thresholds and automatically removes unnecessary keyframes from selected properties. It helps clean up redundant keyframes by comparing their values within a specified sensitivity range.

***

#### [[decode.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/decode.jsx))

creates a text layer with slider and dropdown controls to format numbers as currency. It supports multiple international currency symbols, thousands separators, decimal separators, and optional suffixes. The text layer automatically updates based on the slider values, making it easy to display animated currency values in compositions.

***

#### [[delete all effects.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/delete%20all%20effects.jsx))

deletes all applied effects from the selected layers in the active composition, leaving them clean of any effect controls.

***

#### [[essential renamer advance.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/essential%20renamer%20advance.jsx))

links selected layers in the current composition to newly created nulls in a chosen target composition. Position, scale, rotation, and opacity of the selected layers are driven by expressions pointing to the corresponding nulls, enabling easy control and animation across compositions.

***

#### [[expression editor.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/expression%20editor.jsx))

provides a floating Expression Editor UI for selected properties. You can view, edit, apply, load from a file, and save expressions to a file, making it easier to manage and reuse expressions across projects.

***

#### [[main drop down.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/main%20drop%20down.jsx))

creates a null layer in the active composition with a dropdown control effect. It allows you to quickly set up a controller null for driving animations or expressions using the dropdown menu.

***

#### [[path to mask.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/path%20to%20mask.jsx))

copies selected vector paths from shape layers or existing masks and creates new masks on the same layers. It ensures only unique paths are duplicated, making it easy to convert shape paths into editable masks for further animation or compositing.

***

#### [[rename original file.jsx](https://github.com/miomuhammad/nice-after-effects-scripts/blob/main/rename%20original%20file.jsx))

renames the footage file of the first selected layer in the active composition. It updates both the file on disk and all references to that footage within the project, ensuring consistency across the After Effects project.
